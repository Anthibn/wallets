# Wallet deployment

This repository should be used to deploy muti-signature wallets on L2 chains, since these are not yet supported by most wallet providers and we need one for the governance contract for Tellor on L2s.


This repo contains the gnosis safe and multisig contracts from: 

https://github.com/gnosis/safe-contracts
https://github.com/gnosis/MultiSigWallet
